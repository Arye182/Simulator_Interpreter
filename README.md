# Simulator_Interpreter - Mile Stone #1

# Project Name : "THE FLIGHT-PRETER Ver. 1.00"
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

#Personal Remark
this is our first milestone project in course 89210 that  
we did as couple and as a team. at first it was very challenging but once  
we understood the dividing work flow it all went much easier.
at first time we actually had to put our trust in each other and rely on the
partner that everything he suppose to supply me is good (like a black box).

#Description
in this project we actually "take" a plane "Cessna-172-P" and depart it in the well
known Flight-Gear (https://www.flightgear.org/) simulator of flight.
our mission was to fly the plan successfully, but on top of that we actually
support every command that you could possibly want to set in the flight gear
simulator.
in other words, we built an Interpreter programm that take a language of
commands that our instructor wrote, and interpret her first in a lexer and
after analysing the text we parse it in the interpreter in order to execute
every command or instruction.

Programming - Topics we Used:
-----------------------------
* Using Pattern Designs and Architecture
* Communication and Client-Server Architecture
* Using Data Structures and DataBase
* injecting files and data to server and receive as well
* Multythread Programming

# Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

# Visuals  
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

# Installation  
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

# Usage  
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

# Roadmap  
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

# Contributing

# Authors and acknowledgment  
in this opportunity i would like to praise and thank Miri Jungreis - my partner
, that
was very strong and dominant in managing the team of this project.
